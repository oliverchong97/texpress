Express:

- back-end framework
- basic at its core


Why Express?
- much easier to build web apps on NodeJS
- light, fast, free
- full control of request and response
- great to use w client side frameworks, as everything is Javascript


Good to learn:
- HTTP status codes
- JSON
- higher order array methods


MIDDLEWARE

- express has built in middleware, but mW also comes from 3rd party packages

MIDDLEWARE CAN:
